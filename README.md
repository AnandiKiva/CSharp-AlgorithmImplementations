# CSharp-AlgorithmImplementations
A C# collection of algorithmic programs including AVL Trees, Priority Queues, and QuickSort applications — developed as part of my ITDCA module. Demonstrates strong understanding of data structures and efficient algorithm design.

# ITDCA Data Structures and Algorithms Projects

This repository contains four algorithmic projects developed in C# for the ITDCA module.

## 📘 Projects

### 1. AVL Tree for Book Listings
Implements a self-balancing AVL tree to store books by publication year.  
- Ensures O(log n) efficiency for insert, delete, and search.  
- Supports chronological ordering and traversal.

### 2. Extended AVL Tree
Builds on Q1 to add:
- In-order traversal  
- Search by year  
- Find the most recent book  
- Count total books

### 3. Clinic Priority Queue
Simulates a clinic ticketing system where patients are served by urgency (priority 0–4).  
Commands include ENQUEUE, DEQUEUE, PEEK, COUNT, and DUMP.

### 4. QuickSort Hotel Data
Reads hotel data from a JSON file and sorts by rate, stars, or distance using QuickSort.  
Outputs hotel names in sorted order.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- C#
- .NET
